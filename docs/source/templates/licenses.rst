Licenses available
==================

*Implemented in 0.0.3*

Most of my projects are free to use for anybody and released under MIT license.

For freelance projects I often do not set any license, as I sell some piece of
code and then it is customer decision how to use or sell this.

So I decided to include only this list of licenses:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   licenses/asl2.rst
   licenses/bsd-3.rst
   licenses/gnu_gpl3.rst
   licenses/mit.rst
   licenses/unlicensed.rst

You can click license link to look at template that was used for particular text.
I recommend use of `https://choosealicense.com <https://choosealicense.com>`_ to
choose you license wisely.

.. warning:: If None selected, license file will be dropped.

Feel free to make pull request with new license included.

License pull request should have:

- License template for ``LICENSE`` file in project root.
- License template for ``docs/license.rst`` file.
- License option in ``setup.py`` file.
