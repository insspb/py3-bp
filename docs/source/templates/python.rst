Python versions available
=========================

*Implemented in 0.0.3*

This boilerplate include two questions about python version for your project. 
First is minimum python version supported, second is maximum python version
supported.  
This two answers should be between available python versions:

- Python 2.7
- Python 3.2
- Python 3.3
- Python 3.4
- Python 3.5
- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8

With default settings only three of them enabled:

- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8

This setting required to configure documentation templates, `setup.py` template
and CI/CD templates if enabled.

For most freelance projects it is highly recommended to drop as much old python
versions, as possible. This makes development and testing straightforward and
exclude compatibility issues solving for developer and customer.
