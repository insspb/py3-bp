Python versions available
=========================

This boilerplate include mention of most python versions used in past time,
this include:

- Python 2.7
- Python 3.2
- Python 3.3
- Python 3.4
- Python 3.5
- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8

With default settings only three of them enabled:

- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8

This setting required to configure documentation templates, `setup.py` template
and CI/CD templates if enabled.

For most freelance projects it is highly recommended to drop as much old python
versions, as possible. This makes development and testing straightforward and
exclude compatibility issues solving for developer and customer.
